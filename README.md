# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## 1. Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to use different methods to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. I resampled data using oversampling (RandomOverSampler and SMOTE), undersampling (ClusterCentroids), and a mix of both (SMOTEENN). Then, I compared two models, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, that reduce bias to predict credit risk.
